1gkk58i,"I would slowly introduce products into your routine and keep to the basics. - The first one is a Hyaluronic Acid serum which will help with dryness. It works and isn t pricey. I heard good things about the Ordinary HA. - Then, a vitamin C helps with brightening and dark spots. Vitamin C products are tricky because Vitamin C is an unstable ingredient so you would want to look around a bit. I personally use Vit C from Murad, Sunday Riley Educated Mess. - Retinol, which is Vitamin A, helps increase skin cell turnover and reduce fine lines, dark spots, and acnes. I used to use La Roche Posay but I now use Tretinoin which is the prescription strength of Retinol. Many online services offer Tretinoin these days so you don t need to go to a doctor office for it. - Moisturizer with peptides can help with fine lines and skin barrier. Inkey, CeraVe can be good starting points. - Sunscreen. I use Korean sunscreens from Skin1004 Beauty of Joseon. For American sunscreen, EltaMD is highly recommended. I used it for a while when I was dealing with acnes. Since your skin is dry, I would switch to washing with a hydrating face wash instead like CeraVe.",2,True

It s difficult to say for sure what the issue is without pictures but I wouldn t be surprised if this is related to skin barrier damage to due washing with shampoo. Also, some people get issues with Cerave products, especially their moisturiser as it tends to cause clogged pours. Take a break from using any actives for a few days then go with something like this AM - Wash just with water. Azelaic acid 10-15 , cetaphil light moisturiser. Sunscreen Skin1104 Centella sunscreen is a good choice for acne prone skin . PM - Cetaphil cleanser, retinol cerave resurface retinol is a good starter , cetaphil moisturiser. I d only exfoliate twice per week, I d swap out the cetaphil cleanser with a saliyic acid wash for those 2 days per week.

1g62mjv,"Hi I am currently using Epiduo and have had great results. I have oily skin which can be sensitive to actives. For me, introducing Epiduo was trial and error really, only using it when I thought my skin could handle it, this was anywhere from every day to every 3 days, building up slowly. My routine is fairly similar to yours, in that it is really basic. This is my routine when I first started, AM La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser 1-2pumps massaged in for 60seconds removed with wash cloth cerave moisturising cream in tub quantity depended on how dry my skin was wait 10 mins Eucerin hydro 50 SPF 2 fingers PM La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser 3-4pumps massaged in for 60seconds removed with wash cloth cerave moisturising cream in tub quantity depended on how dry my skin was wait until soaked in If Epiduo night I d apply it all over if my skin was particularly dry sensitive I would wait 30 mins and apply a small amount of la Roche posey cicaplast over the top. When my skin was tolerating Epiduo this way I alternated between applying Epiduo first and moisturising first. when using Epiduo first I apply a small amount of moisturiser first to around my eyes moisturiser goggles Dr Sam calls it . There was no strict routine to it, I just learned when my skin could handle Epiduo directly, when it needed a buffer and when I needed a night off from it. When my skin was tolerating Epiduo well and I was using it before moisturising, before moisturising I would use the mighty spot patches on any big spots that had come to a head. When I did this and I was still getting red from Epiduo I ended up with a slight ring around the patch where the patch appeared to reduce the redness There are a few things you can consider How much Epiduo are you using on your chin? If you are using the full pump, you ll be using too much. I put equal dots of it on each cheek, nose, forehead and chin before rubbing in. It could also be that Epiduo just isn t right for you, you could try adapalene and BP separately Acnecide and Differin and introduce them slowly You could try contact therapy which seems to work for some people who can t tolerate actives well I don t know too much about it It could be that neither are the right treatment for you",2,True
1g4fefq,"a before photo would have been nice, but i ll work with what we ve got. as the cerave resurfacing serum is technichally an exfoliant, purging is basically expected. unfortunately, purging and breaking out in skincare is difficult to tell. i expect that it would be purging and not breaking out, but continue to use it a little more. if you don t see improvements or they get worse then ditch it, it is breaking you out. a rule of thumb for skin purging vs breaking out is working out which products affect skin turnover. these ones are likely to purge, but could also still break you out. this includes vitamin a what you ve got , vitamin c, benzoyl peroxide, exfoliants, etc. but products that don t affect skin turnover, so things like moisturisers, sun creams, and cleansers don t cause skin purging unless one has ingredients in it that affect skin turnover . so if those do break you out, ditch it.",2,True

Cleansing it daily, then using quite heavy moisturisers.

The water only wash is just a gentle way to rinse my face. No need to wash with anything harsh since my face generally doesn t get dirty nor do I wear makeup. So since my face isn t getting stripped too much, a lightweight gel moisturiser is fine. I might on the odd night use Cerave blemish control gel moisturiser with 2 salicylic acid, just as a measure to keep my pours unlocked Also, try shaving with a safety razor if you don t already.

1dyjduu,Use a gentler non-exfoliating cleanser instead. I really like the Cerave foaming oil cleanser. As for which moisturiser? It s pretty much just trial and error to find one that works well for you. I m currently using this one. It s a bit lighter than the Cerave cream and it sinks in easier. Try not to judge yourself so harshly immediately after washing. I find that no matter how gentle the cleanser my skin always looks a bit more inflamed than usual for an hour or two after washing.

Final option 5 Your skin is actually not that bad and I think the above two would help alot but if it still doesn t go away then Accutane. Accutane was the only thing that really helped me to get rid of 99 of my acne. I was on it two times actually as a year after the first time half of my acne came back.

I actually use the garnier rose water toner. It s so good and really good value for money. I also moved away from using Cerave cleanser every day as I felt it really dried my skin out. I use the blemish control one about twice a week now which I feel works for me! Also eye cream, just something hydrating will work.

So you can try using a more gentle cleanser like the hydrating one from CeraVe, or the hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser. In the evening, start with an oil cleanser to break down all oil, dirt, sunscreen etc. Make sure to keep your skin moisturised by using a moisturiser morning and evening. This is what I d recommend for your full routine Morning - CeraVe cleanser - Moisturiser on slightly damp skin - SPF Evening - Oil balm cleanser - CeraVe cleanser - Tretinoin - Moisturiser A couple of times a week you can use salicylic acid in the evening as it s oil soluble and will get deep into your pores.

1d1tb5z,"Hey! I think you have closed comedones CC . To me, it could be your cleansing oil or your cerave moisturiser that could be exacerbating them. This means although you are adding in a BHA, the bumps will never disappear. Most of the time as I said CCs product induced but could be a little bit of fungal acne? I would reccommend and anti fungal cream or even just anti dandruff shampoo used as a face mask for a few days to see if they clear up? I have combo skin like you and found any type of straight up oil cleanser exacerbated my clogged pores. I use the ordinary squalane cleanser still an oil, but more of cream and simple face wash. As you are feeling a little dry, you may be stripping your skin too much during cleansing? I found that all the cerave cleansers did this to me and made me super oily but also very dry.

1cvasgo,"Firstly well done on getting this far and I wish you every success in getting your health back to a place where you feel healthy and happy in your own skin. You ve got some decent products in your arsenal there that will definitely help to get your skin back to good health. Focusing on the basics will give you a great foundation and something to fall back on if some days are too hard to do all the things. I m concious you have a lot of exfoliating products in there - try not to fall into the trap of over exfoliating as this can cause dry skin and might even damage your skin barrier. Especially as you have a retinol in there as well which can also be drying. If it was me I d alternate between the exfoliating acids and the retinol to mitigate this. The cleansers I m not as much concerned about as you wash them off. A weekly routine could look like this AM day 1 Cerave foaming cleanser C C blackhead toner E45 moisturiser and or SPF depending on the SPF PM day 1 Charcoal mild exfoliating cleanser retinol E45 AM day 2 Cerave foaming cleanser C C blackhead toner E45 moisturiser and or SPF depending on the SPF PM day 2 Cerave foaming cleanser TO Glycolic Acid - leave for 30 mins - E45 Day 3 same as day 1. Day 4 same as day 2. Day 5 same as day 1. Day 6 same as day 2 Day 7 same in the morning - PM use foaming cleanser and finish off with the salicylic face mask. Here s where you can use a nice hydrating sheet mask afterwards as a treat or bask your skin with a thin layer of zinc cream like sudacrem. Wirth regard to the SPF its personal preference - use 30 SPF in the summer months, just find one that you like, doesn t sting the eyes and feels comfortable on your skin. Edited to add - if your blackheads cysts are causing you the most concern, maybe look to get an extraction facial rather than a hydrating one? This might be a better solution for you at this stage of your skincare journey. Good luck and I wish you well",1,True
1cvasgo,"Start slow and simple, get used to doing a routine, then work your way up from there I would start with the CeraVe cleanser morning and evening, followed by the E45 moisturiser. In the morning, followed with SPF - if you want an affordable one that s easy to find, Nivea do some good facial sunscreens. Once this has become a habit, you can add your Dermatica treatment a couple of times a week in the evening, and exfoliate once a week. See how your skin reacts and you can increase decrease the number of days a week you use actives as required. Hope this helps!",1,True

It took 3 or 4 weeks to show only results but it s the only brand that has helped her and now if she goes without for a few days usually when we run out of the tiny tube of gel it will get worse. I found Cerave absolutely useless for the most part but she does use the SA moisturiser. The regular hydrating one stung her. Give the Acnecide time to see if it works,2,True

Niacinamide breaks me out, a vitamin c serum caused mega irritation my own fault, my barrier was damaged from overusing Epiduo Forte , micellar water makes my skin feel gross etc. Being an obsessive face skin picker certainly doesn t help lmao.

1cm774s,"Congratulations! I too have PCOS with a spotty jaw and am 8 weeks pregnant, desperately awaiting my pregnancy skin glow up. Personally I would get something that cleanses a bit better than just micellar water for the evening. Perhaps adding a basic hydrating foaming cleanser to your routine either a Cerave branded one or Simple. For the spots, benzoyl peroxide gel sold branded as Acnecide over the counter is safe during pregnancy. I apply it to clean skin over the entire area affected using a cotton pad or bud it s notorious for bleaching fabric . Wait until it dries and then carry on with the rest of my routine as normal. Make sure you wash your hands afterwards. Like retinoids it increases the skin turnover and also kills the acne bacteria. It can be drying on your skin so you may wish to start out applying every other day. If you have coloured pillowcases you may want to consider daytime application only. I have oily skin so I double cleanse with an oil cleanser in the evening but you might not need this. I would start out with just the cleanser and BP gel. Don t change your entire routine at once.",2,True

You re kinda just smearing products on top of all that and that can t be making the pizza face situation better I actually use micellar water and CeraVe hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser to double cleanse and my skin looks less textured overall than before I started. I like the acnecide suggestion another user gave, however I find benzoyl peroxide to be a bit irritating which is why something called short contact therapy for BP exists and find salicylic acid to be just as effective without the irritation. Though ofc YMMV and you may end up liking it. Your routine could look something like Micellar Water optional, but still ok to use CeraVe Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid gel to Spot Treat Moisturizer of Choice- Right now I ve been loving the Aveeno Rehydrating Night Cream it can definitely be used both morning night, I have oily skin and find it to be very moisturizing yet without leaving my skin wet or greasy feeling!

1clwice,"They told you to wash your face 2x in the morning with 2 cleansers that have salicylic acid, and one is even a scrub? face_screaming_in_fear They even told you don t need SPF? Wth I think the Cerave blemish cleanser is a good place to start, use about 2-3x a week once a day . Alternate it with a gentle cleanser like the Cerave Cream to Foam or Aveeno Calm Restore Oat Cleanser, or Byoma Jelly Cleanser. You most definitely need an SPF during the day. Pick whichever as long as it s at least SPF 30, and reapply every 2-3 hours. Use 1 4 tsp for your face.

I agree with everyone else to drop the cleansing oil and toner for now. Note Simple original range is like . the least irritating range of products I know. Less irritating than Cerave, E45.

I think it used to be but they changed their formula when they got bought out some years ago. I think the culprit is the fatty alcohols in it. You can try swapping out those products as a start. The links above might be outdated, use Incidecoder or an app like Yuka to find updated lists of ingredients. Unless you wear makeup or waterproof sunscreen, you don t need a cleansing oil. So I would drop that for the time being too. The Anua 77 toner is a popular product but also not necessary, especially if you re trying to investigate what is causing breakouts and they started while using it. Try to stick with just non-Cerave cleanser, moisturizer, and a sunscreen and see if you see any improvement. On days when you don t need to cleanse like if you stay indoors all day and didn t use a sunscreen you can also try just cleansing with water. Personally, I use the Cetaphil gentle cleanser, Simple hydrating light moisturizer which has niacinamide, and a Korean sunscreen with niacinamide Skin1004 . Niacinamide for me has been great for anti-acne but it can also irritate some people so it s not for everyone.",3,True

But it s a good one to start with so that your skin can get adjusted to the ingredient retinols can sometimes cause minor irritation when starting to use . Plus that is sold in a lot of drugstores so easy to find. Something a little better would be the Naturium Retinaldehyde 0.05 Once your on the 0.05 strength for 4 months, and your skin has fully adjusted to it i.e. no irritation , you can opt to increase the strength to 0.10 The retinols that work the best, and which are most potent, tend to be expensive. SkinCeuticals is the only one I d suggest for an experienced retinoid user, but it s pretty expensive. Note retinol and retinaldehyde are both retinoids They are very similar, but absorb a little different. So, you CANNOT compare a retinol strength to a retinaldehyde strength. Because retinaldehyde converts quicker in skin, you have to use a lower percentage formula. You can only apply retinoids at night time because sun light bright light destroys it.",1,True
1gkrwso,"Ya there are so many cerave products, this one was a recommendation from a dermatologist on Instagram years ago and I have never looked back. For the toners, depending on the humidity ratio at that time of year, I use the blue astringent ocean breeze or a witch hazel toner. Do you wash your face at night or in the morning or both? And have you seen a dermatologist for these concerns? Also am I the gigachad or are you? Lol",2,True
1gkrwso,"Good on you for taking initiative, my dude! As someone who has had a skin care routine since the 4th grade due to incredibly acne prone skin- I may be of help. INFO - what are your skin goals? Looking to cut down on oil production? Help clear up and prevent acne? Anything else? My first 3 things I would recommend to you and honestly anyone are easy and cheap 1. My skin has been a similar oily mess in the past so HEAR ME OUT but you know those toilet tissue paper covers that are in bathrooms? Those are a literal vacuum for oil. Pull out the top one and chuck it and then use the next, clean one and use the rougher side one side is a little more waxy, this side is not as affective and DAB your face NOT rub with the tissue liner. Literally pat it on your face, rotate to a clean part of the tissue, and keep going all over your face this way. By dabbing, it will absorb up the oil. I personally had to do this around like 1-3 pm and then at like 5. This was recommended to me by an aesthetician when I was a pimply, junior high mess and I scoffed and thought it was gross but she said she has done this for years. And now I have and never had any pink eye or gross reactions. Those oil blotting tissues really added up in cost after a few years so this was a great alternative. 2. When washing your face, try to air dry your face, don t dry your face with a towel. I will dab my eye brows and neck but that s it, everything else never touches a towel. If you think about it, your towel is probs a breeding ground for germies so simply don t use one to dry your face. 3. For body acne, i have found that the cerave acne foaming cream cleanser 4 is the perfect balance for my body acne. I will wash my body with this and then I use an exfoliating body wash cloth with a neutral body wash on the cloth and scrub my whole body after putting this cleanser on. The cleanser works the best if it has a bit of time to sit on my body, so the cleanser goes on then I scrub with it still on. Post shower I also have found using toner on a cotton pad on the affected areas creates a little bit of a seal.",1,True
1gkrwso,"Then the downvotes were worth it. The gigachad has arrived in the house, everyone. To answer you, yeah, I basically would love to not be leaking oil on my face constantly throughout the day. People always say don t touch your face with your fingers, but for me it s the opposite. My fingers are nice and dry right now and if I rub them across my forehead, they become slimy and gross. It s so so unattractive to glisten like I ve oiled myself for an 1980 s workout VHS tape. Everything you ve said is something that is new to me so thank you so much for sharing because I will go out and try exactly what you suggest- I ve never heard of that Cerave product because frankly they make way too many overlapping products that I never would have picked it at random.

1gka1bv,"Consider the sources these are people who have an interest in you feeling insecure about your skin and maybe paying them more money. For my ridiculously dry skin, the winners are Amore Pacific line brought my skin back to life. It s super expensive so I couldn t afford to keep up. Then I did well with the Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench line. These days, my broke self is using Hyaluronic Acid and a moisturizer from The Ordinary, Tatcha sunscreen, and still working out a nighttime routine. Currently Paula s Choice BHA and Cerave nighttime. My skin is doing good these days. I m not sure if jumping directly to my current routine would have fixed the issues I had at my worst. No way to know now. Last thing - make sure you re exfoliating enough. I need to exfoliate frequently. Despite being sensitive to perfumes, I can wear The Ordinary s glycolic acid at least every other night. If you can see flaky skin, or if moisturizers or makeup tend to sit on top of your skin, you may need more exfoliation. Then the moisturizer doesn t need to fight to get to the healthy skin. Caution - go slow with exfoliation. Too much is worse than not enough. Damage can take a long time to repair. I hope you find your magic mix.",2,True

The only two things you really have to do is sunscreen cleanser to remove sunscreen. Were you using different cleanser, moisturizer, etc. when your skin was clearer?

1gel17n,"Hi there! You may have dry skin which can also sometimes mean more sensitive so a very elaborate skincare routine with 16 products would be unnecessary and not helpful. Your routine is simple and that s already very good. I think something that could help you is to add more moisturizing products and maybe doing a double cleanse at night just to be extra sure you have gotten off all the makeup and sunscreen completely off. That CeraVe hydrating cleanser is great, I would stick with that and maybe try the Hydrating Cream To Foam the bottle with the green text on it which is their newer version. It foams up nicely and gets off makeup and sunscreen off a little better than the regular CeraVe hydrating one but is still gentle and not stripping, perfect combo for someone with dry skin. There are cleansing balms you can buy which is the first thing you use at night after washing your hands. It looks like a thick lotion in the container but as you scoop some out and rub it all over your face, it becomes oily and dissolves everything dirt makeup oil etc. so use this first and then rinse off. Then use your CeraVe wash. That s what makes it a double cleanse Last thing I might look into is an over the counter retinol and adding in a hyaluronic acid serum. Retinol needs to be applied at night only, after you wash your face and pat it dry. Retinols can be irritating so use only once a week at first and try to find one that s a lower percent or a weaker one, or maybe one that s targeted for dry skin people. Hyaluronic acid can be applied whenever really, you can put a small amount of it under your moisturizer in the morning or at night, you can put it under your sunscreen also. It ll help plump up the skin and make it look less dry. Introduce products one at a time if possible so if something doesn t suit you, you will be able to know which one is causing an issue. If you can find something to exfoliate with once or twice a week, like Paula s Choice 2 BHA, that can help you too, it s not a necessity but it ll help slough off dead skin over time. Retinol can have an exfoliating effect as well so I would choose one or the other - don t be using both at the same time or your skin might peel and become irritated. I am not a dermatologist but this is just what I would recommend as a fellow dry skin person in their early 30 s. I hope this helps x",1,True

Why do you want a salicylic acid wash? From what I know SA is not very effective for things like clogged pores, acne etc in the wash formula because it needs to stay on your skin for some time to work, it also might make rosacea worse so watch out for that. I ve been eyeing Paula s choice spf 50 with vitamin C but haven t tried it yet, they usually have great skincare. Personally I have combination sensitive skin with rosacea and I either use ultraviolette tinted veil spf 50 as my foundation or lrp anthelios fluid spf 50, cerave moisturising lotion, and the best oil wash for me has been bioderma cleansing oil followed by avene foaming cleanser since I m acne prone, I also use retinaldehyde by geek and gorgeous for my fine lines although retinoids aren t recommended with rosacea, but it doesn t seem to make mine worse.

I haven t tried this product so I can t really comment on it but if you haven t bought it or want any recommendations, let me know! Paula s Choice and The Ordinary have 10 ones that are great. Like another user mentioned, cleansing oils! I would substitute the makeup remover balm for a cleansing oil since it also has skincare properties!

Cerave and Burt s Bees have a few options too. If your skin is currently sensitive I would try maybe Niacinamide before Salicylic Acid. It is gentler. At least until your barrier heals a little and or the redness goes down. A few great products are Paula s Choice 10 Niacinamide Booster, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10 Zinc 1 , Inkey List Niacinamide Serum, SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense, Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence, First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum Or if you really want Salicylic Acid, the La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment has both Niacinamide and Salicylic Acid.

It sounds simple, but keeping hydrated really does make a big difference. - Add Moisture Layers. Consider layering a hyaluronic acid serum like The Ordinary s or La Roche-Posay s right after cleansing. This draws moisture into the skin, which can plump up those lines over time. Then, lock it in with a moisturiser. I use Cerave the one in the big tub , but you might have to experiment and find one that works for your skin. - SPF is Non-Negotiable, even on cloudy days. UV exposure is the number one cause of premature aging, so if you re not already, find a broad-spectrum SPF 30 that you like. This can help prevent those rough or aged appearances. - Retinol. You re already doing great exfoliating 3 times a week but consider a Retinols, a prescription retinoid like Differin if possible. This will help target fine lines, wrinkles, and skin texture. Start with a lower concentration to see how your skin tolerates it like 0.25 or 0.5 and apply it only 1-2 times a week to start. You ll want to pair this with your SPF, as retinoids make skin more sensitive to the sun. - Eye Cream with Peptides to address the lines under your eyes, look for an eye cream that includes peptides or caffeine to help smooth and tighten the skin around your eyes.

BP can also make your skin sensitive to the sun, so a gentle cleanser could be a good alternative if your skin becomes too dry.

1glwb7t,"Hi dear, maybe I can give you some ideas products to try. First off, the diet plays a crucial role in your overall skin health. Maybe your system has developed a new sensitivity? It could be laundry detergent, perfume, dish soap, cleaning products, citrus fruit, gluten, anything lol.Im not gonna mention blood work and all that because I m sure you ve done that! Try to eliminate things that could trigger it and switch to green, 100 non toxic natural things. Always always wear gloves. You could try castile soap which can be used for laundry, dishes, fruits veggies, cleaning and body hair although it s too drying on my sry skin. I use black African soap for my hair and body. I use a lot of Shea moisture products, their honey hair mask is divine. I m actually not the biggest fan of cerave, they re just OK imo. But their HEALING OINMENT IS SOOO GOOD lol I use it all over,i really recommend you try it in place of Vaseline. Warm it up and only need the smallest amount. Have you tried pine ta tar? It s amazing, it s antiseptic and antifungal, very healing, look up cutar emulsion on amazon panthenol for healing, very important ingredient. Calendula, soothing, nourishing, healing. Anecdotally, I ve heard amazing things about vit D cream for even curing eczema. Colloidal oatmeal is very soothing and takes away the itch and irritation. Sulfur, another smelly one but it WORKS with my skin so well. German chamomile u could get essential oil and mix it with a cream AND take it internally, makes a delicious tea. Pair it with Manuka honey BAM! I do Manuka honey masks or leave it on a problem area when I m home reading etc and wipe off before bed because it s sticky but also could be mixed with other ingredients in a cream. Try making your own of all the ingredients you like, a SUPER POTION. add some aloe, goat milk, sea buckthorn oil cold processed and organic of course oh and HEXANE free. I have more to share but trying to keep it a chapter VS a book, haha. All these ingredients have been studied and praised for their efficacy. You should also be supplementing with HIGH QUALITY herbs and supplements. There are so many superfoods which are medicine.

1gkvvwi,"When fighting with closed comedones we need to remember that it requires patience and regularity. So having that in mind, lets focus on 3 main areas 1. Cleansing 2. Exfoliation 3. Moisturizing 1. CLEANSING MORNING 1. Gentle cleansing gel or foam with no actives in it. I really like Cetaphil products but it s a very individual matter so u need to find the perfect match on your own. EVENING If u wear makeup or SPF - double cleansing in the evening is a MUST. 1. Product based on oil don t worry not every oil is harmful for your oily combination skin, in fact it s great in terms of deep cleansing which is crucial in anty closed comedones routine . I have acne and since I started using oil based cleansing product, I truly see the difference. 2. Product with gelly or foam formula - it s going to be our emulsifier to dissolve the leftover oil. Friendly note remember to wash your face in lukewarm water, have a separate cotton towel dedicated to your face and change it minimum once a week I change them every 2 3 days . 2. EXFOLIATION very important What it does? Exfoliants gets rid of dead cells accumulated on the skin surface and that leads to unclogging of pores and deep clean them. There s many exfoliants on the market. U mentioned salicylic acid which is a really good one however a concentration of 2 is insufficient to cleanse pores. Considering your irritated and sensitive yet quite oily skin, I would recommend mandelic acid 5 . Further in the process you can switch to 10 . How often? Start small once a week. After 2 3 weeks u can do it twice a week. Friendly note apply a small amount of product each use. Observe your skin and give it time. 3. MOISTURIZING Last but def not least step! If we missed this step, we would get even more oily skin production of sebum is our skin s defense mechanism and irritated skin. Choose light yet rich formulas. Seek for products that are dedicated to acne prone skin cause that kind of products shouldn t clogged your pores. Personally I really like CeraVe Moisturizing lotion with ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Use it in the morning and evening. Additional things hydrate yourself hydration from the inside is super helpful in process of reducing skin problems change your pillow covers regularly pay attention to your diet veggies are great but be careful with fructose and lactose intake Move your body more often for me it was a game changer, also its a science based claim don t forget about SPF even on cloudy days I hope that will be helpful 3 Lots of love and if u have any questions, im here for you!",3,True

It s literally because it contains propylparaben which is a highly effective preservative that is demonized by natural or clean beauty for no factual reason. These brands will choose not to use preservatives bc they re toxic and then their buyers wonder why their stuff turns rancid. Most of the fearmongering is based on a flawed study in 2004 that is constantly cited despite not proving any causation. The gist was that their samples of breast cancer tissue contained parabens, but they literally never even compared it to healthy tissue, which could have also contained and showed that there s no link between the two. The study also didnt detail all the possible causes of how the parabens were introduced in the first place. Additionally, the blank samples containing no tissue in their studies had higher levels of parabens than the cancer tissue. There are clear guidelines of what level of certain ingredients are considered safe. There have been multiple studies since showing even if you used a ridiculous amount of it every single day in multiple products at the highest allowed concentration, you d still have used tens of thousands of times less than the level that is considered still safe.

Then rebuild a routine from there. Accutane has a ton of risks and it doesn t look like like you have deep cystic acne so I d try to exhaust all topical options first.

1gjlpaw,"So firstly remember that consistency and patience is key especially when it comes to acne. Using a product for just a few days doesn t give it enough time to work and it may take some time to see results. So you may want to revisit benzoyl peroxide or other over the counter products with consistency. If you return to a dermatologist, try to stay consistent with any topicals or anything else they give you. Then if you don t see results after that you are definitely a candidate for Accutane. The next thing I ll point out is the things that can really impact acne that are easily overlooked, like 1. Washing your sheets and pillowcases AT LEAST once a week. 2. Drying face after cleansing with a clean towel. 3. Not touching your face. 3. Cleansing immediately after working out or lots of sweating. 4. Using gentle products that won t aggravate active pimples. If I were you I would start by washing at night with a 10 benzoyl peroxide wash, moisturize after cleansing, and incorporate a sunscreen in the morning. If you want to wash your face in the morning use a gentle cleanser like the CeraVe you have. Then I would get another appointment with a dermatologist and stay consistent with what they give you. They should set up a follow up and if you aren t seeing results even after using the products for a few months, push for an Accutane prescription.",4,True

Im allergic to benzoyl peroxide, sacylic acid ruins my face, I have had many breakouts just from lotions. Has your derm tried antibiotics and tret? I agree with the others with taking a probiotic. Prescriptions that worked for me- doxycycline, sodium sulfectamide sulfer wash, Clindamycin gel, tret .05 and for a while I was using dapsone gel along with all of it. It was quite a battle but I have been clear for a while and am down to just the wash and tret. I still use clindamycin as spot treatment now and then. Cerave was the worst lotion I used and caused cystic acne on my face. I stick to gel type moisturizers. One that is good for oily skin type is lrp double repair MATTE moisturizer. It does contain niacinamide in it which could help too. Good luck!",3,True
1gjlpaw,"I also struggled with acne for a long time until I was 27 or so, not much different than this. A couple things finally helped me after trying almost everything under the sun for years. 1 La-Roche Posay Effaclar Duo 2 Adapalene 3 Prioritizing moisture Every night oil cleanse your face we ll get to why you need to oil cleanse in a sec , then apply the LRP and Adapalene. Then make sure to moisturize with something heavy like Cerave s healing ointment. In the morning, rinse your face with water, no need to wash, and apply an SPF. The SPF is why you need to oil cleanse at night. Change your pillow case and do your routine every night without fail. Ease into using the products and let your skin get used to it. Maybe start 1 night on, 3 nights off, and work up to every night. On the nights you aren t using the products you still need to moisturize and oil cleanse, and you still need to wear sunscreen every morning. Also get some excercise and plenty of water and eat healthy foods. If you use hair products find a way to prevent it from getting on your pillow in your sleep.",2,True
1gjlpaw,"Cerave moisturizer may be the culprit. The cerave pm gave me an uncontrollable breakout. But aside from that, I think you should visit a derm. They can prescribe tret or tazorac to help clear this up.",2,True
1gjlpaw,"Tretinoin my man. Tretinoin. Also ditch cerave, go with vanicream. Cerave is notorious for breaking people out.",2,True
1gfsnyp,"If you are already using a Cerave cleanser, why don t you simply follow it up with a Cerave moisturizer? They work together beautifully. I can t imagine that you would have a bad reaction. Cerave products are great",1,True
1gfsnyp,"You always want to follow with moisturizer after a cleanser, even when starting a new routine. Cleansers typically don t break people out unless they re allergic or it has an active like an acid in it that s damaging the skin barrier. I would try using the cerave oil to foam cleanser though if you have dry skin. I find the hydrating one to not clean very well, and sometimes burn when my skin is sensitive could be just me though . If you want to try the Bha, use on clean dry skin and only 1-2 times a week to start and always follow with a moisturizer. Bha s are known to cause skin purging breakouts so be aware that that might happen. I would actually advise using the Paula s choice mandelic acid over the bha since it s much gentler. Bha may be too strong to use for first time using acids.",1,True
1gfsnyp,"i was reading a lot about the Cerave moisturizer on here other skincare subs and a lot of people experienced breakouts and comedones, so i tried to avoid it honestly, i get anxiety with too many options so once i read that i was like no thanks, and moved on lol",2,True
1gfsnyp,"Seems to me, you ve already skin tested Cerave by using the cleanser. If anything, I would stick with the brand your skin knows. Less anxiety than switching brands, IMO",1,True
1gf3opo,"Stop the Dr bronners soap and switch to a gentle cleanser like cerave daily foaming face wash. Use the cerave SA cleanser 2-3 times a week in the pm. Other wise use the daily foaming wash . Keep up with the double cleansing in the PM. You could have a disrupted skin barrier and I agree to cut back on the SA toner to maybe a few times a week. If you start using Differin gel, then stop the SA toner. Start with using the Differin gel a few times a week in the PM after cleansing and follow with a moisturizer. Once your skin adjusts you can start increasing frequency of use, to eventually get to using it nightly. For the AM I think a product containing azelaic acid could be really beneficial since it gently exfoliates while also being antibacterial, so it s great at treating and preventing acne. Just be sure to follow with your moisturizer and a good SPF.",3,True
1gal6dh,Maybe the CeraVe moisturizer with SPF? I also like Laneige,1,True
1gafxxg,Cerave helped me a lot for my acne,1,True
1gafxxg,"Cerave hydrating broke me out badly. I love cerave foaming. You might also want to double cleanse with miceller water before your PM face wash. Most importantly, go see another derm. There is so much more than accutane. I saw you tried tretinoin. Have you tried other prescription topicals- dapsone, azelaic acid, tazorac, adapalene now OTC or oral meds like antibiotics or spironolactone? My skin is very reactive and I irritated to the point I was embarrassed to leave the house by trying diff actives to clear it. A derm got things under control with short term antibiotics and a combination of topicals. Now I stay 99 clear with topicals alone. Beware that hormone balancing can be big scam territory and unregulated supplements can cause adverse health effects.",1,True
1gafxxg,Echoing what most people have said about visiting the dermatologist again. Have you checked the products you use? CeraVe is raved about by most in the sub but I used the moisturiser and cleanser in separate routines and they caused bad cystic acne for me,1,True
1ga5qne,"so i live in the philippines, so i dont really know if the products i use are available to you. but some products i use are from the ordinary, specifically their glycolic acid toner, tho some people react really badly to it because its pretty strong. i just started reintroducing it again to my routine after getting rid of my active pimples. for micellar water, im using the garnier pink cap, just apply it to a cotton pad and swipe it across your face a few times, use as much as you need until you feel like the sunscreen is off. i usually use 3-4 pads since i wear makeup sometimes. then lastly for bha, i use the oxecure 1.5 cleanser but only when i feel like i have to, usually i use a baby wash, its called tender care with the blue pump. its pretty gentle, the only problem i have is that it has a pretty strong smell, but i think my skin can tolerate it. also some people react badly to snail mucin or the cerave cleanser, but i havent personally tried the cerave one, the snail mucin broke me out so much lol. that s all!",1,True
1ga1fr9,"It sounds like you re going through a tough time with your skin, and I totally get wanting to find the right moisturizer! For a lightweight, matte finish without the risk of closed comedones, you might want to try La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid or Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel . Both have a similar texture to CeraVe PM but are less likely to clog pores. Another option is First Aid Beauty s Oil-Free Mattifying Gel , which provides hydration without that greasy feel. Make sure to patch-test any new product first, and hopefully, one of these will work well for you! Hang in there, and good luck! glowing_star sparkles",2,True
1g84ad8,"I tend to keep it pretty basic with cleanser, but over the years I ve loved both Cerave and Cetaphil for daily cleansing if I m breaking out more, I ll switch to Cerave s salicylic acid cleanser and let it sit on my skin a bit before rinsing off.",2,True
1g7znzk,"Hi, I got a similar case to yours a few years ago, after I wasted around 150 dollars, there are some details you can see to determine if it s fake or not, so I ll break this down based on what I know, Packaging the real packaging have a more matte feel than the fake one, and the silver color on the real packaging can be noticeably more reflective Bottle 1 the real one is usually smaller, but not always 2 the hole on the real one is smaller than the fake one 3 the thread for the cap on the real one is always 2 threads, the fake one always have more than 3 threads Cream 1 the real one is runny, it spreads evenly on the skin, if you try pinch and lift the cream there s less than 1 cm hangs down. The fake one feels more like a snot or glue tbh, it often clumps when you try to spread it, and if you try pinch and lift the cream there s more than 2 cm hangs down 2 the real one have less bubbles small bubbles , the fake one s bubbles looks more like those bubbles on body soap big bubbles Usage try and use it, this is the most effective method to determine if it s fake or not, it s risky, especially when the fake one has some questionable ingredients you don t know about, but you can see a noticeable changes when you use the real ones compared to the fake one All and all, from the information you provided, the bottle size seems like the old one is smaller, but as I said, the real bottle size is just usually smaller. For the hole size, I can t clearly see the it for comparison. The cream consistency on the recent one is more thick, but try the pinch and lift method, and see how long it hangs, it doesn t bubbles too which is actually the real one s trait, you mentioned that your skin even got better after using the recent one too, so there s a chance that the recent one is actually the real one and the old one is the fake one. But try to confirm it based on the other details I ve mentioned tho. TLDR Those information are based on what I got back from 2021 2022 I don t really use this CeraVe products anymore, so I don t know if there are some recent changes in the fake CeraVe product world",3,True
1g7znzk,"I am from Philippines and CeraVe doesn t have official store here. I bought it online and the seller claims that they sell authentic CeraVe product and even got certification but when I don t think so because it looks different from packaging to consistency, this is a foaming cleanser and it doesn t even bubbles but the OLD one I got doesn t have this problem. face_holding_back_tears",6,True
1g7znzk,I do use it everyday and clears my acne and doesn t have problem at all. Now that I emptied it I try to buy again but the one I got seems fake. Planni g to switch to Cetaphil instead since my country doesn t have CeraVe official store pensive_face,1,True
1g7znzk,"No, I am from Philippines and CeraVe doesn t have official store here and the one I got online says products they sell are sourced from US but I don t think so.

1g6qdrm,What cerave products r we talking about? I also struggle with eczema when using the wrong products but I find the hydrating cleanser works pretty well for me,1,True
1g5eeoy,"Honestly a lot of it. You should use a cleanser for oily skin, not dry skin. There s also a looot of ceramides in this routine, the CeraVe gel is probably enough. Skip the vanicream and switch the snail mucin for a zinc serum.",1,True
1g5ct91,Email CeraVe directly and ask with better photos,3,True
1g5ct91,At first before I opened your question I was like why would it be fake it isn t this horribly expensive brand but the. I read everything so my apologies for judging the cover. It does look. eyes interesting. I like the person that said email Cerave with photos. black_heart,2,True

1g5ct91,"I also contacted Cerave to verify my goods from the 3rd party seller of Walmart. They just replied thank you, we will investigate it. I google other resources and found the easiest way is to check the bottom of the container. It s fake if there is a circle. I have 2 purchased from drugstore without circle, but those I got from 3rd party have it. So I returned them right away.",2,True
1g534v9,I have had really good luck with cerave! They have a good foaming gentle cleanser and then a gel moisturizer that I use every night.

1g2wllf,"Congrats. I do think there are moisturizers out there that could work for you and give you the same effects. I had to broaden my search to kbeauty to find moisturizers that worked for me. But cerave, Cetaphil, vanicream, la Roche posay not it.",1,True
1g2wllf,"Did you cut out water, too? It s processed not to contain bacteria that are detrimental to humans. Tallow comes with risks, and I m sick of people pretending every chemical is dangerous. It stinks like hell all the tallow I ve smelled unless it s packed with perfume. When tallow apparently works for someone, all I hear is I didn t moisturize properly , so my oil glands were overproducing to make up for it, which led to my acne. You only tried Cerave and every moisturizer but tallow is bad? You were getting 20 new cysts weekly your face would be covered and didn t see a derm? I call this post Cerave shitting and fake.",1,True
