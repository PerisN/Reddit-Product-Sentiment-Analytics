1glu6la,beauty,Seeking Advice,Help with skincare routine for a guy,"Hi, Recently, I ve been considering expanding my skincare routine. As a 20-year-old, my current routine is fairly basic I use a face wash gel in the morning, followed by an SPF cream, and in the evening, I use the face wash gel again and a night cream moisturizer. Once a week, I also use an enzyme exfoliant. Although I m still quite young, I ve noticed noticeable wrinkles on my forehead, which made me start researching products to address this and now my head is spinning from all the information. I ll admit, I m not very knowledgeable in this area, and most of what I know has come from videos, websites, and forums. This is why I m looking for advice to make sure I m not overthinking or overcomplicating things. My plan is to keep my current products and add a retinal serum with a very low concentration, an eye cream, and a cleansing foam I was also considering adding vitamin C, a serum, and a toner to really clean my face thoroughly, but that might be overkill . Another issue is that every video I watch recommends a different product from a different brand, which makes it hard to decide. I m not sure if I can just go to Rossmann or Hebe and buy everything, like a Nacomi cream, gel, retinol, etc., all from one brand, or if I need to mix products from different brands. Or maybe I should keep it simple and just get products from CeraVe? They have kits with face cream, gel, and serums containing retinol, acids, etc. Just in case it s relevant, I have normal slightly sensitive skin. I could really use some guidance because I m feeling lost in all of this.",0,0,2024-11-07 16:16:04,False,False,0,https://reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/1glu6la/help_with_skincare_routine_for_a_guy/
1gkk58i,beauty,,What skincare routine after 30?,"Hello everyone! I hope I m posting in the right place! Please let me know if this is not the case My question is basically in the title, I m a 32 year old woman, I don t know much about skin care. I try to find out what I can on the internet but I find it difficult to sort through all the information. I would say that I have normal to dry skin at times, especially in winter in cold weather and it is localized on the nose area, around the nostrils, corners of the lips and the top of the cheekbones . From time to time I have 1 or 2 red spots that go away within a few days. I read that from the age of 30, it is good to apply products based on collagen hyaluronic acid peptides vitamin C. I started with a hyaluronic acid cream found at Action , which moisturized quite well , I bought the hyaluronic acid treatment the ordinary which actually doesn t moisturize as well, I am left with areas that are a little dry. A priori, I saw that the brands the ordinary, cerave, Laroche Posay among others stood out quite well, are they worth it? I also read that the best was Korean skincare, but the same, how to sort through all the information found? Basically here is my routine, morning and evening 1. I wash my face with soap Aleppo? I m not sure. It s a hard soap, which is dark gray black 2. I apply the hyaluronic acid cream 3. I wear makeup, kohl powder and mascara only, no foundation or anything else 4. In the evening, I apply a homemade castor oil castor oil mixture to my eyelashes and eyebrows. In this regard, what about Vaseline which is said to be a miracle product for eyelashes, eyebrows and lips? Is it more effective than castor oil and castor oil? When the mood strikes me, from time to time I make a homemade scrub with baking soda and coconut oil. And that s about it for my skincare. I tried to be as precise as possible, I welcome any comments or suggestions I am obviously aware of the fact that each skin is different and that it can be complicated to give advice on the spot.

1gf5m0c,SkincareAddictionUK,Routine Help,Help please desperate!,"Hi everyone, I 28F am feeling extremely frustrated with my skin. I have been lucky with my skin my whole life without ever struggling with texture or spots other than hormonal acne, but since this year, my skin has not been good. Over the summer, I was using exclusively baby shampoo to wash my face I started using it a couple years ago due to an allergic reaction and it completely cleared up my hormonal acne so I never looked back , a light moisturiser think L Oréal hydra genius or Clinique moisture surge with Clinique mineral sunscreen 50 SPF. I was using a bare mineral foundation and removing my makeup each day with a variety of products, either an oil based makeup remover like Clinique take the day off or just micellar water. I don t use waterproof makeup generally . My skin honestly had never looked better with this routine. However, my skin started to become really dry and I think it is because of the mineral sunscreen. I tried a different one, but it made me feel oily. I then tried Aveeno oat cleanser instead of baby shampoo and using other Aveeno hydration products, but I was still struggling with a weird combo of oiliness and dry patches. Fast forward to this week. Thinking my face was dry, I stopped using a moisturiser and Clinique SPF and swapped to cerave 30 day SPF cream, which I used to use daily prior to switching to Clinique and a boots hydrating serum and night mask I think it s hyaluronic based which I ve used as a serum before . Now, my forehead is covered in what looked like closed comedones never had these before and I ve got a ton of closed comedones non pus filled spots all over my cheeks. My skin has truly never looked worse, it looks dehydrated, dull, spotty, textured - and it s so oily! I just feel completely lost. I bought an inkey list PHA toner and BHA serum. But I don t want to use them both at once or should I ? I was thinking to start with one but I really don t know which is better. Please help, I struggle with skin picking disorder and having lots of bumps on my face is a sensory nightmare. I just am really struggling and don t know how to fix my routine. I ve also been eating a lot of sugar the last few weeks, so I ve decided to stop that, too, just in case just cutting back, no chocolate etc and eating as little processed food as I can. I drink a ton of water everyday as it s my favourite thing to drink, I don t really drink alcohol etc. Any and all advice from a really desperate person please folded_hands loudly_crying_face",1,11,2024-10-29 21:10:04,False,False,0,https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/1gf5m0c/help_please_desperate/

The Byoma stuff is lighter but still after a few hours my face is shiny and greasy looking. I ve been using the Simple cleanser for a couple of months, before that it was Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and to be honest I don t notice much difference between these. I ve used a ton of different moisturisers in the past - CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion - La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Fluide Moisturiser - La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Soothing Face and Body Balm - La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Moisturiser Sensitive Skin - Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion - Mizon Black Snail All in One Cream Some have worked better than others but it s hard to remember which were best as I ve tried these over the course of many years. I have a feeling La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Moisturiser Sensitive Skin worked nicely but seemed to be discontinued after I finished my first bottle, there are some similarly named versions now but they don t appear to be the same. I think my skin is sensitive and combination? Though not really sure. If I don t moisturise it tends to get uncomfortably tight and flaky , I think as a consequence of a couple of courses of Roaccutane years ago. Shaving also irritates the hell out of my skin, normally at least 1-2 days after I shave my skin will be extra sensitive and shiny looking, but given my crappy facial hair genes I m forced to shave every 2-3 days using an electric foil shaver, dry. Somehow it seems to be less irritating than if I wet my face first. It s been many years since I ve tried a normal razor blade safety razor though I remember them causing irritation too, but maybe some fancy shaving cream would help.

I used it once a day for a couple of days and cut out all my other skincare except for moisturiser but I used a different, more nourishing one . I was having no bad reaction to using it once a day, so I boosted up to twice a day and that was fine too. I saw that a lot of people have had better success with the leave-on gel rather than the wash-off stuff, so I went and picked up some of that too. Now, I use the facewash in the mornings and have slowly re-introduced cerave retinol serum into my routine too typically would do this at night but I don t want my using the retinol to coincide with my using the leave-on gel , I use the leave-on gel in the evening, and I use hyaluronic acid twice a day. It s been about a week now and I m not sure if I m using these products correctly? Everyone warned me about how drying and irritating this stuff can be, especially when combined with retinol, but honestly I haven t noticed that at all and wouldn t have increased my usage if I did . Am I just lucky? Or could it be a sign I m not doing it correctly? I use as little of the gel as possible as I ve heard you don t need much, and I leave the facewash on for 2 mins while I brush my teeth. Also not sure if you re supposed to use both products at the same time? But I figured if you can use one of them twice a day, why not use both once a day? Idk.

The dermatologists I m searching up are really expensive and so I m looking to get a few products that I can use to start of with. I got advice from a superdrug employee and they gave me a few suggestions. They said to use these products in following order Morning- CeraVe Blemish Cleanser Neutrogena face scrub with salicylic acid Simple Hydrating Light Moisturiser Followed by at night using CeraVe Retinol Serum Both the serum and cleanser are ok with me but as I was searching I saw having both a cleanser and a scrub with salicylic acid was bad for the skin. So is there any other scrub I can use instead that would work well with this and is fairly inexpensive? Also how often should I use them? Also I saw a lot of places recommending a sunscreen after using both a retinol and salicylic acid cleanser. But I was told the simple moisturiser was enough. Should I get the one with the spf or opt for a seperate sunscreen as well? So far I ve only used the L oreal Hydra Energetic - facewash and face scrub with the anti fatigue moisturiser as my daily routine, but noticed even as a daily use they didnt help at all, but I could just be using them wrong.

Literally no one I know has a skin routine, so I m trying something that is completely foreign to me. Ok so I tried Lumin in Feb charcoal scrub, charcoal cleanser, moisturizer , and Lumin s charcoal scrub is amazing, I love that- the cleanser was good as well, but the moisturizer was oily and not great for me Then I got the Geologie trial a month later SA cleaner, dark circle cream, PM retinol solution, AM cream sunblock Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid and I noticed an improvement in the quality of my skin- the color, the glow, but no change in oil level- the eye cream also worked a bit, although it did cause hard pimples around my eyes. Stayed on it for 2 months but Geologie is bloody expensive, and I read that CeraVe is basically the same thing so I switched. On CeraVe SA cleanser, Am Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30, PM retinol serum, eye cream , that glow improvement is gone, the eye cream seems useless, and I m just about out of product, so I d like to hear some suggestions for what I can try next. I have really oily skin- you could wax a car with my face an hour after I ve showered. I ve got acne on my face, back, chest, arms, legs, etc. the pores on my nose are always fully clogged, I get facial pimples on my forehead and cheek and little cysts around my eyes. By the end of the day, my eyes are stinging because of the oil and salt building up around them. I ve never found anything that will solve this- only the Lumin scrub has helped because if I use it in the morning, it cuts down on the amount of oil already present on my skin that even a hot shower won t clear away. Please help- I m here to learn and I m absolutely willing to go back to the brands I ve already tried if there s a product I missed.

Couldn t have done it without y all, thank you so much. Original Post Here with my desperate cry for help. My skin is back to its former glory. Now it s just dry af. No longer do I suffer with dehydrated skin with itchy, flaky rashes. My face does not burn from merely existing. I can have other thoughts than my face hurts. My skin is in its best shape. Mama, we made it. This is one of my greatest achievements to date. What a journey that I never want to go on again. Skin background DRY, JUST BLESSEDLY DRY, in a hot humid environment southern USA . Not acne prone, but allergic to many things. Outside job, so sun protection is a MUST. THE ROUTINE REVIEWS everything in order of application AM - warm water wash - USE my hands pat dry with a towel. - Torriden Solid In Ceramide Cream - non-greasy but thick, and cosmetically elegant. Nicely hydrating. Doesn t pill under sunscreen. My poor skin was thirsty. USE AM, PM after shower. applied on slightly damp skin. - Face Republic Purity Sun Essence - FINALLY a sunscreen I don t sweat off but still comes off when I use a cleanser! It s moisturizing, no white cast, and does not sting. Sunscreen alt for when I m not at work - Beauty of Joseph Relief Sun Rice Probiotics - If I want compliments on my skin that day I ll pull out this. Gives my skin a nice glow. Great for hitting the town lol - Rohto mentholatum Lip Fondue - very moisturizing for my crusty af lips, and a perfect purse companion. PM - Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser - no frills, no nonsense, basic cleanser. Does the job reminds me of myself. Completely removes my sunscreen. I m a bit gross so all the spots I thought were sunspots were actually dirt clogged pores. This cleanser helped me see the light. I might also use this on my scalp to remove sweat buildup but don t tell anyone. USE every night, before shower. - Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule - redness just disappears. Irritation has been reduced using this method. USE directly after coming inside from the farm, immediately after washing my face, before shower. applied on damp skin, otherwise this shit burns. - Dr. Ceuracle Vegan Kombucha Tea Essence - it s luxury. That s it, that s the review. I don t have many nice things, but I have this. My skin has never felt healthier or plumper. USE every night, after shower, before moisturizer. - Torriden Solid In Cream - Avene Cicalfate Repair Cream - y all. were. right. This stuff is magic. It healed those gross itchy patches on my face. USE as an ointment. spread a layer every night before sleep. Initially wore it everyday for 2 weeks in AM PM. Dropped it down to 5x a week after work and let my face rest over the weekend. Now, use after the most intensive days in the sun, so 3x a week. And here s what didn t work - CeraVe moisturizing cream - I m allergic to this bitch - Tirtir Milk Skin Toner - made my skin dry flaky I ve retired these - Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 - it didn t leave a white cast, but do I really want to be aggressively rubbing in this sunscreen everyday? no. Ya girl got places to be. - Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Pack - it was too lightweight. Replaced with Torriden. I m still on the hunt for an even better waterproof sunscreen for intense sun protection. Bonus points if you ve made it this far and can rec me one in the comments. Good luck, y all.

1gad11y,30PlusSkinCare,Product Question,In Search Of a Retinol Body Treatment or Product That Smells Good woman_in_steamy_room_light_skin_tone cherry_blossom,"So I m searching for a retinol product to include in my body skincare routine, but with a twist I want one that actually smells good! Yes, I know fragrance in skincare can sometimes cause irritation and is generally frowned upon, but when it comes to my bath and body products, I m all about indulging in great scents. Don t worry too much though I m diligent about only using fragrance-free products for my face. But for body washes, lotions, or treatments, a product that doesn t smell amazing is just not worth my time or money. That said, I do have one exception I ll consider a fragrance-free option only if it s completely unscented. And I mean unscented- with no. smell. at. all. I ve been disappointed too many times by products labeled unscented that end up having that super lotiony smell to them or, worse, ones have that gross smell that some active ingredients can give off after application, and have you walking around smelling like cat pee cough Amlactin cough . When I buy a fragrance-free product, I expect it to smell like nothing like I literally put water on my skin. No scent, no smell, not even a hint of one- zero, zilch, nada. That way, I can layer with my own body spray, or just enjoy a neutral experience. To me, a product should either smell incredible or like absolutely nothing anything in between is a criminal offense in my book! oncoming_police_car maybe a little over dramatic lol, but I have very strong feelings about As for fragrance types, I m not picky I love them all gourmands, florals, orientals, warm, woody, fruity, fresh. As long as it smells good, I want it in my life smiling_face_with_open_hands Of course, effectiveness is just as important! I m looking for a good-smelling retinol product that actually delivers results as well. I m starting to notice the early signs of aging fine lines, slight loss of radiance, and some texture issues. Obviously retinol addresses those concerns and more, plus, it supports anti-aging efforts, so it was clear that I needed to incorporate it into my routine from head to toe I use Cerave s Retinol Serum for my face I m still newish to retinoids . I m also using face and body products with AHAs and Hyaluronic Acid for additional skincare benefits, but I will be alternating those with the retinol. I ve rambled on and on for long enough about what I m looking for and how picky I am , and now I m really hoping a product like this exists! crossed_fingers_light_skin_tone If anyone has tried or heard of a great-smelling or truly unscented retinol product, please share your recommendations I d really appreciate it. And if there s interest, I ll be sure to post a review of whichever product I end up choosing after I ve had a chance to try it!

Recurring breakouts from oily skin was always a problem. Watching diet helps, washing helps, but neither ever really had a lasting effect. And I was always baffled that the more that I washed, it seemed to sometimes have a negative effect. I tried a Geologie kit but I didn t really believe in it or stay regular so I gave up. Then recently I was doing some reading about washing stripping natural oils and your face then over producing them, causing breakouts. And it clicked. So I started a routine that included moisturizing and it has been a huge improvement. Smoother skin, fewer pimples, less redness. I know I ll still get minor break outs, especially if I don t wash soon after sweating, and the pores on my nose are always going to be large, but I want to maximize my routine with the best products.

I just don t know what i m doing wrong as I do the same thing everyday. It really makes me insecure. What can I do to stop pimples from forming? I know it doesn t look that bad on camera but trust me it really just ruins your day as I can t even put makeup on to cover it as it can just worsen them create new pimples.

1gmrac4,SkincareAddiction,Acne,Acne The routine that cleared my acne,"Praise God my skin is free of new breakouts. After years of struggling with acne I want to make this post to help others. This is my experience with 17 years of skin troubles and finally finding a solution which has kept my skin good for around 2 years. I always wanted to make a post like this but wanted to wait until I had a solid routine. This is a 3 product routine but you must pay attention to the detail to stay acne free. The three products are 1. CeraVe Foaming Cleanser 2. Acnecide s Benzoyl Peroxide in 5 strength 3. La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo M Moisturiser WITHOUT SPF! First wet your face with warm water use one pump of cleanser, rub in hands to foam, cleanse face and rinse. No washcloths or tools just fingers. Whilst face is still wet use a small amount of benzoyl peroxide around a pea size or a little more if needed wait 5-10 minutes for it to fully absorb into skin Use moisturiser liberally to moisturise skin, make sure you use enough, you dont need to rub it in too much it will absob into the skin. And that s it a simple routine, you can do this once or twice a day. But if your skin is senstitive or skin barrier broken you should wash your face less as you need the skin barrier to heal. I hope you have a breakthrough in your skin care journey and no more addiction, Kind Regards, J Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.",1,1,2024-11-08 19:48:05,False,False,0,https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1gmrac4/acne_the_routine_that_cleared_my_acne/

So today I casually had my skin barrier checked at the local Kiehl s store. I did a first full skin analysis in May 2024 , so about half a year ago. Back then my skin barrier was 96 . It saddens me to say it was 56 today . To be honest I don t really feel or notice it s worse. I sometimes break out, I did then, I do now, it is what it is. I don t really have more stress now than I did back then. So of course I immediately started thinking what I changed in my habits and routine now compared to then. I want that 96 back. Then Cleansers Mostly Cerave Cream-to-Foam Cleanser or The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser . Serums and treatments A lot of The Ordinary stuff barrier support serum, niacinamide 10 ,. and Paula s Choice C15 Super Booster in the AM and The Ordinary Granactive Retinoids in the PM not every day Moisturizers Mostly The Ordinary Natural Factors HA or The Inkey List Omega Water Cream Sunscreen Mostly La Roche Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Now Cleansers Mostly Cerave Cream-to-Foam Cleanser in the AM and double cleansing in the PM with Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Oil Cleanser and Iunik Centella Bubble Cleansing Foam . Serums and treatments A lot of Korean skincare things mixed up both in the AM PM. Numbuzin 3 or 5 , Skin 1004 serums , switching it up. Moisturizers The Inkey List Omega Water Cream or Rovectin Lotus Water Cream in the AM and Purito Cica Barrier Sleeping Pack or the Klairs Midnight Blue Cream or sometimes La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume . Sunscreen Mostly Beauty Of Joseon Relief sunscreen. To sum it up Obviously I discovered Korean skincare the last months, so I use Korean and western things, before it was all western stuff. I definitely didn t double cleanse then, now I often do, just because it feels nice at night. It s so weird because I even use barrier supporting moisturisers at night. Oh yeah, and I started doing Red Light Therapy with the Qure mask a few weeks ago. I did often use the pink The Ordinary barrier support serum back then, that might be an option. I m thinking just going back to basics and using a gentle cleanser in AM PM and a thick moisturiser like Cicaplast in the PM would be good? Or just specific barrier supporting things? So, if anyone has any idea what I could change and or what could ve caused it, I thank you in advance for any input.

I m now 23 and I have gotten the red inflamed pimples contained and only breakout if it s that time of the month or I m stressed from a new environment. NOW the only thing I have continued to struggle with is closed comedones. They have been on my chin for as long as I could remember. I popped them and they d still come back. I changed everything about my skincare routine EXCEPT my moisturizer. I didnt believe it was the problem as I was using the Cerave moisturizer that SO MANY PEOPLE USE! Come to find out that was the main issue all along! I did a deep dive for about a week, scouring the internet, Reddit threads, TikTok, etc. for ways to get rid of these pesky skin colored bumps. I came to the conclusion that Cerave was sh t and that I needed to find a moisturizer that was Non-comedogenic AND fungal acne safe. This lead me to try the PURITO Oat-in Calming Gel Cream. THIS CLEARED MY BUMPS IN A WEEK! Now the only thing that I would say is a negative would be that it is not as moisturizing as I wish it was. Now I m struggling with dry patches around my mouth and chin area. I m trying out some oils like grapeseed oil to see if that helps. Also I find that the moisturizer can burn a bit if I don t let my skincare dry down before I put it on so warning to that as well. Right now my routine is this AM wash face with water, leave a little water on my face and put on the Purito moisturizer, let dry and go in with the Innisfree sunscreen. PM if wearing face makeup use micellar water, wash face with PanOxyl, use Clindamycin Phosphate Solution 1.0 let dry , tret 0.05 , go in with the Purito moisturizer trial of mixing it with a couple of drops of grapeseed oil . I also take spironolactone everynight as well. I ve struggled for so long with the skin colored bumps on my face and it just feels so good to get rid of them without thinking I need so many exfoliants or extractions!

Also, products based around hyaluronic acid are the only ones that sting me.

Came to the conclusion that I have no idea what the feck I m doing. None of it made sense. I think shea butter was the only one thing that I felt I could absolutely single out as not for me with certainty. Rate of acne when I say I break out, I mean I break out in the span of hours . Not trying to be dramatic. But I ll put on a moisturizer overnight and wake up with new acne. It was even worse with SPF. I d apply it in the AM and I had new acne buddies by the time I got home to cleanse it off. Very rapid acne reaction from SPF, more larger acne, still have massive PIE from this June. Couldn t find a single SPF that didn t do that to me. and yes, I cleansed it off properly . The acne always a combo of veeery small whiteheads and fewer slightly larger deeper set inflamed looking acne that never actually seems to come fully to the surface. like it s plump but missing the white poppable jucky part. Almost more like a small red blister - So those kind of just .dry off and the PIE marks in those spots linger .forever. Fun.

1gl97qr,SkincareAddiction,Product Question,Product Question reaction after using epiduo benzoyl peroxide,"I have very sensitive, combination skin that s prone to acne. Around 2 years ago, I saw a dermatologist who prescribed epiduo benzoyl peroxide and adapalene . I experienced some dryness, redness, and irritation at first. I expected this after reading about the products and being instructed by the dermatologist to quit using all other liquid products including makeups, lotion, etc. on my face. It worked great for reducing my acne and I had relatively clean skin with only a few breakouts and no extreme adverse reactions to the products. Since then, I ve quit adapalene all together, and I just use benzoyl peroxide by la Roche because I ve found it causes less dryness while still helping with my minor breakouts. I usually only use benzoyl peroxide on spots where I breakout twice a day when I have a break out, every other day when I m clear . I ve been using it twice a day for the past week on my chin, cheeks, and forehead where I m breaking out with acne. I haven t experienced dryness or irritation with the product in a while, but today, immediately after applying, I felt a strong, painful burning. I figured it would go away within a minute and I wasn t worried, but after 5 minutes it had worsened and my face was extremely red. I rushed to wash it off as best I could, but I only got minor relief from the cold water. I have a really high pain tolerance, but I was practically in tears because of how badly it burned. It got to the point I sat with an icepack on my face to calm the burning. This pain lasted for over an hour followed by tingling. 10 hours later my face is still pretty red and super sensitive to the touch. I can t imagine it s a product reaction, I only used a CeraVe face wash for sensitive skin and a little vitamin C serum under my eyes. Has anyone else had a similar reaction?

I usually only use affordable products, but I have acne-prone skin, and a friend recommended La Roche-Posay, saying it worked for them. So I decided to give it a try. A couple of weeks ago, I started using the Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel and Effaclar Duo M twice a day morning and night . At first, it seemed to work well most of my acne has improved, though it s not completely gone. However, after 7 10 days of use, I noticed my skin became very dry and flaky. So I stopped using the products, and when I went to a health store, they suggested I try Cicaplast Baume B5 to repair the dryness. They also recommended I continue using Effaclar Duo M, but just as a spot treatment for acne, since it s drying my skin when used all over. I still don t know if it s the Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel or Effaclar Duo M or both that make my skin dry After a few days of using Cicaplast Baume B5 , my dry skin are starting to improve, though not fully healed yet. But I m unsure about what to do next. Should I keep using Cicaplast Baume B5 and Effaclar Duo M as my skincare routine, or should I switch to other products? I ve heard CeraVe is a good option, but I m still not sure what s best for my skin. Any advice would be really appreciated!

I also have some raised scarring leftover from deeper acne pre accutane. On my face and neck I cleanse with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, I dab tendskin on my neck once a day usually after shaving , and then I use tirtir ceramic cream as my moisturizer for day and night. - also after shaving I make sure I clean my razor with rubbing alcohol so I know it s clean for the next time. For my chest, I usually wash it in the shower with aveeno scent free body wash, then again with panoxyl. When I m dry out of the shower I moisturize with cerave body moisturizer the green one . I also sleep with a clean t shirt on every night, although I find that I sweat a lot at night.

1ggdwpl,SkincareAddiction,Acne,Acne Closed comedones that become inflamed?,I ve had acne for 4 years 24f now that started during COVID when I had to wear a mask all the time and never resolved. Prior to that I would only get the occasional pimple on my forehead all throughout my teenage years Lately it s been getting worse and I don t know what to do about it and it s really affecting my self esteem. I ve noticed that it originally starts off as these little bumps under my skin and then becomes a whitehead later on. It gets more red inflamed around my period and also improves at times but is never gone. I work in healthcare so I still do use masks occasionally. I notice that when I m at work my entire face is super oily and the pimples are more red and inflamed even when I don t wear a mask. When I m at home my skin tends to be dry. Things I ve tried Vegan for 8 months when I first had this issue didn t help Retinol from TO Benzoyl peroxide and adapalene Salicylic acid Glycolic acid I find my skin prefers this instead of salicylic acid but i was told that this wouldn t unclog my pores. Acid exfoliants I found made my skin more oily as well Trifarotene Hydrafacials and micro dermabrasion with extractions helped the skin a bit but never got rid of the issue I tried the dermalogica clear start kit as advised by an esthetician but it wasn t hydrating enough I could only use it on days I went to work because my skin is oiler then I found that active ingredients really damaged my skin barrier and made it a lot worse so I began using eucerin 5 urea repair cream and that helped rehydrate my skin along with hyaluronic acid. Even after fixing my skin barrier I still had this problem What I m doing currently Making sure I exercise and manage stress I have long and irregular cycles Making sure I sleep well I take magnesium and vitamin D Drink tons of water Change pillowcases weekly and sleep with my hair in a bonnet Products I currently use I tried to go back to my old highschool skincare routine because my skin was good back then Cetaphil oily skin cleanser I tried the cerave SA cleanser and I think it damaged my skin barrier Glamglow supermud mask 2x a week I still have some of this and ive been using it since highschool just to treat problem areas Dermalogica daily microfoliant every other day Raw Shea butter at night Eucerin 5 urea repair during the day I feel like the bumps are more visible and some have a little black dot in them especially on my chin but at the same time I keep getting more I m pending a dermatologist appointment Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Routine Help","For context, I am F19, have no history with acne except a few mild breakouts here and there and have combo to oily skin. I have never ever broken out on my cheeks as I m doing right now. The first 3 pictures are my skin right now, the last one is from July. I was still breaking out on my forehead and chin possibly due to sunscreen sweat bangs combo but it was not nearly as bad as it is now. My skincare routine the past year or so has been pretty simple, consisting of - CeraVe oily skin cleanser - CeraVe moisturizing cream in the AM and PM as well as - COSRX AHA BHA toner OR - La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo on some nights usually about 4x a week I rarely use sunscreen as it also breaks me out but when I do it s the La Roche Posay Anthelios Oil Control Fluid. One possible cause I can think of is that I switched from moisturizer in a tube to the same one in a tub, which is less hygienic. However, I always make sure to wash my hands and or use hand sanitizer before dipping my fingers in the tub. I know the COSRX toner and LRP Duo contain salicylic acid which I originally incorporated into my routine hoping to get rid of my blackheads and texture around my nose and chin. They worked fine at first and I m wondering if perhaps I overdid it and damaged my skin barrier and that s why I m breaking out? Did I randomly develop acne? Is the moisturizer or cleanser to blame? Am I missing a step? Should I scrap my entire skincare routine and start fresh?

What I started using is vaseline, but I might have been a little too extreme with it. I started slugging putting a smaller than pea sized amount of vaseline over my moisturizer. BOTH in the morning and in the evening. I ve been recommended the Dove original beauty bar for healing my face, and I ve used it twice since instead of CeraVe . The thing is, I m breaking out and I have a lot of closed comedones. The signs of damaged barrier are obviously still here weird shiny patches of skin, redness after touching my face etc. My question is What do I do? I might have been slugging too much, right? Should I slug maybe every three days, PM only? Should I use the BHA sometimes? Could it be The Ordinary moisturizer causing my possible keratosis pilaris? Should I continue using the Dove syndet to see if it helps? Should I try to use the Sudocrem only every few days? Should I start oil cleansing again? Is the shiny skin caused by not enough moisture? I feel like whenever I use a little bit more of my moisturizer, it gives me more closed comedones and even pimples. The thing with Sudocrem is that it helps me sleep better. I like having the feeling of my red spots being covered, either with a hydrocolloid patch or with Sudocrem. I don t feel good going to sleep only with moisturizer on. So I m basically addicted to it, lol. I don t really have the money to buy any new products. If you were to recommend something to me, I think it s worth mentioning that I m from central Europe, usually shopping at DM.

1g6fbbt,SkincareAddicts,,Routine help Getting my skin back to normal after anua oil cleanser,"Hi everyone, I am new getting into skincare and was too quick to buy and start using that anua five step skincare routine, as I saw so many good reviews. I even looked for reviews past what I was seeing on my fyp to see if people really liked it. Seemed like they did! I ve been using it for a month and a half now, and suddenly like.really suddenly I am having deep painful acne bumps that don t have much of a white head. I was thinking it was hormonal, but I normally don t have skin issues as bad as this, so I did some more research with the trusty users of Reddit, and turns out lots of people are having the same reaction I did from the oil based cleanser. And it seems to be very damaging and hard to get back to normal. I have mostly dry skin, and my skin can stay pretty consistent if I use the correct products, I believe. Before I started the Anua five step routine, all I did was my ceraVe hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser. Literally all I did, no sunscreen, no serums, nothin. That was working okay for me, but just not great. I still have textured skin and have some acne scarring I wanted to go away. I also wear a good amount of makeup every day. So that s why I started the new skincare routine. It was an easy five step routine that was already put together, and people seemed to enjoy. Plus my best friend has amazing skin and puts a lot of effort into her skincare routine. Also, I don t use the toner in the Anua kit, because it broke me out where I was using it and heard it was pretty drying. I instead use the round lab toner. The order I use them are Am foam cleanser, round lab toner, niacinamide serum, then the lotion Pm micellar water, OIL BASED CLEANSER, foam cleanser, round lab toner, niacinamide serum, lotion. It was honestly hard for me to get used a skincare routine after 20 years of living, and I feel jipped that I spent so much time thinking my skin was healing, and then suddenly it pops up in painful bumps. The only time my skin has EVER had these painful bumps was when I was vaping nicotine. I couldn t figure out the cause, and was even going to dermatologists. I finally realized it was the nicotine, and it was the hardest thing I ve ever done but I quit, and acne almost immediately cleared. It was such a direct correlation. So my question is wtf do I do? Do I continue this routine that has been kinda ok seeming it was working until all of this, BUT SWAP the oil cleanser out for my old ceraVe one? Or should I stop everything and go to a dermatologist? I am super new to skincare so it s pretty embarrassing to me that I don t have the slightest idea about what to do, and the plain fact I waited so many years to start creating a skincare routine. Like I don t even have a sunscreen. wtf! It s so hard to talk to people ask for suggestions about skincare because everyone has such different skin. I am Hoping posting on here will help get some different help from people who may have had similar issues to me, or know much more than I do.

I ALSO USE SUNSCREEN IN THE AM, the eltaMD one. - also, i have been on epiduo for about a year and a bit now. my skin has been producing a LOTT of oil in my t zone specifically, it ll start producing oil about an hour after my AM ROUTINE, i don t feel it gets as oily at night though. i m just so lost in as to what could be causing the oil production, my skin feels uncomfortable throughout the day because of it. i ve taken a day or two off from wearing my sunscreen to see if that causes it, i ve switched my moisturizer, but my skin still continues to produce a lot of oil, which hasn t ever been a major problem for me. my skin used to get kind of oily by the end of the day, mostly on my nose. my skin is acne prone, but the epiduo has been helping although it seems like it sucks all the life and moisture out of my face and has had times where it completely sucks. which is why i don t use any other actives and all my products are moisturizing.",19,64,2024-10-17 00:30:39,True,False,2,https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddicts/comments/1g5eeoy/what_within_my_routine_is_causing_excessive_oil/

And my face finally healed or getting healed. Redness is not terrible anymore. And acne is fading. I started using a sulfur soap for my face. Derm gave me this 3 treatment lotions and skin supplement and antibiotic. My concern before is only rosacea and I don t want to deal with acne anymore.

1g2wllf,SkincareAddicts,,I Battled Cystic Acne for 6 Years Beef Tallow Was the Surprising Answer Male,"For the past 6 years, I ve struggled with HORRIBLE cystic acne on my jawline, neck, and cheeks. These painful red lumps would appear on my face several times a week, and leave scars that wouldn t heal for MONTHS. They completely ruined my self confidence, which affected my relationship, my social life, and my self-image. Nothing online gave me a solid answer, since the majority of people struggling with cystic acne are females, not males. None of my friends IRL had cystic acne like mine. I went to several dermatologists over the years, where I was prescribed different creams, as well as fucking ACCUTANE, yet still nothing helped. I tried over a dozen things that the internet suggested, like pressing a warm tea bag to the lumps, switching moisturizers and sunscreens I tried 6 different moisturizers! , and changing my diet. I completely cut out dairy for 6 months and ate mostly whole foods, yet the cystic acne lumps only seemed to get worse. This is when I decided to cut out everything with processed non-natural ingredients from my life, one at a time. For me, my moisturizer was the culprit. I switched to a beef tallow beeswax moisturizer and I kid you not, from the very first week I switched, I have not had a SINGLE cystic acne lump form on my face. I went from having over 20 new cystic acne lumps per month to literally having ZERO cystic acne, just from getting rid of those synthetic moisturizers fuck you, Cerave! that every Youtube video, skincare store, and reddit thread tells you to try. Before trying beef tallow, I was told by my girlfriend that putting it on my face was gross. Her view has now changed after seeing how much it has helped me. After 2 months of using it, I can tell you some things that people get wrong about beef tallow Beef tallow has almost no scent, however the brand I bought from has high quality grass-fed, grass-finished, triple-filtered beef tallow. So I wouldn t put any beef tallow on your face that you find in the food section at a store. Also, the slight, neutral scent that it has is not noticeable by other people, and I literally have to put my nose right next to it in order to smell anything. If you really care about scent, there s definitely companies that offer a scented version. Surprisingly, it is not greasy at ALL. My face does not look oily and my skin feels like.skin? after putting it on. There really is no trace that I have beef fat on my face. The synthetic skincare products that are constantly pushed onto us definitely can have damaging affects, despite how much people in this subreddit like them. If you don t want to use beef tallow, my advice would still be to make your skincare routine as simple as possible, and avoid products with a dozen ingredients you can t pronounce. I hope this helps any other male who is struggling with cystic acne and can t seem to find a proper solution.",27,18,2024-10-13 18:42:54,False,False,0,https://reddit.com/r/SkincareAddicts/comments/1g2wllf/i_battled_cystic_acne_for_6_yearsbeef_tallow_was/
